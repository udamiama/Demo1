                        German Shepherds are famous for their intelligent, loyal, and hardworking natures. They are
                        often
                        used as guide, therapy, search-and-rescue, police, military, and narcotics and explosives
                        detecting dogs. While they can come across as aloof to strangers, they are known to be wonderful
                        family dogs.</p>
